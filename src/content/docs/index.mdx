## Next Generation Architecture

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="The Shell & Registry" icon="puzzle">
    A strict separation between the **Shell** (OS) and **Registry** (User Space) allows for infinite
    extensibility without conflicts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modular Monolith" icon="rocket">
    Develop features in isolated modules, but compile them into a single high-performance
    application.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Additive Schema" icon="setting">
    Define database models in your module. The system merges them into a unified Prisma schema
    automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type-Safe SDK" icon="open-book">
    Every module generates a fully typed SDK. Consume any feature from anywhere with full
    autocomplete.
